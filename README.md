# Time of Use Calculator

A NextJS app that evaluates Xcel Colorado's [Time of Use residential rate plan](https://co.my.xcelenergy.com/s/billing-payment/residential-rates/time-of-use-pricing)
from your past usage and determines whether TOU or Opt-Out is more cost-effective.

The next feature I'd like to add is the ability to parse usage data from billing PDFs.

## Getting Started
